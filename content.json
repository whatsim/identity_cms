			"post" : "1000khz was an experimental narrative about the stories of places that aren't here any more. I was interested in the difference between honoring the past versus preserving it. We think letting a building stand empty is a better fate then knocking it in, that while it stands its something of a monument to what was. I've come to think that's something of a cop out.\n\nBy researching my family history here in Detroit, I was saddened to find the buildings that I am connected to were all gone. However, in that research I found out a lot of things I didn't know about my family, and through the whole experience became more aware of my place in it. I thought that remembering the stories of these people was the more important thing.\n\nSo I built radio transmitters, 1000khz AM, and placed them  around Detroit at places that aren't here any more. While their batteries lasted they played stories of the places where they sat.\n\nThe site I built to solicit stories is now offline.",

			"post" : "I'm a traditionally trained graphic designer with an Interactive and Experience design focus. I'm also a big nerd.\n\nI have strong typographic skills, and I can make books, posters, and all the other things we graphic designers do, and I'm comfortable working with video or motion, but what I'm really in to is interactive.\n\nIn high school I ran a server out of my bedroom for Wordpress; it was my first website not on Geocities. I've always come at things with that perspective of, 'I'll probably figure it out.'\n\nSo far that seems to be working.\n\nI know all the traditional web designer languages, HTML5, PHP, JS, and I'm also very familiar with Processing and Arduino, Plask, Open Frameworks, node.js, as well as Ruby, Perl, and Python. I've coded for physical interfaces, built battery powered analog radio transmitters, scripted 3d animations, and custom coded my last two blogs from the ground up, as well as the CMS for this website. I make little canvas games in javascript for fun.\n\nI'm not afraid of my soldering iron and have a couple of burns on my arms to prove it. I'm a big believer in learning by getting into something and figuring out what I'm doing wrong. Most projects offer plenty of opportunities for 'learning'.\n\nI know the way you make good work is by researching, trying things, and throwing out what isn't working and trying again. I'm not one to just throw things at the wall without knowing why I'm doing it, or learning something.\n\nThoughtfully brute force, I guess.\n\n+ Well versed with Creative Suite (Current to CC)\n+ Experienced with InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, After Effects.\n+ Good hand skills, can cut straight lines without slicing off a thumb. See thumbs.\n+ Know HTML, CSS, JS, node.js, Processing, and Ruby.\n+ Pick up programming languages/environments quickly, know enough Java, C like languages to get what I need done. Familiar with OO concepts.\n+ Can administer a server, or write DNS records.\n+ Can solder as well as any art student.\n+ Experienced working in a studio, plays well with others.",
